üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
In this project, I used a combination of tools to handle data cleaning, transformation, and visualization effectively:

PostgreSQL: Used for cleaning and transforming raw Excel data using SQL queries. It helped in standardizing, joining, and preparing the datasets for analysis.

Tableau: Used to design interactive dashboards and perform visual analytics based on business requirements. Calculated fields were created for deeper insights.

Excel: Used during the initial stage to inspect the data format, correct structural issues, and prepare the files for import into PostgreSQL.
